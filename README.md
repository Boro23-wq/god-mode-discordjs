# God-mode, Built with Discord.js.
Essentially a discord bot that can kick as hard as it can get and display a random hilarious fail gif from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).

> Before you setup and run you need a few settings to configure the bot. Please follow the steps listed [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and get your token.

> You will also need a Giphy API key to get access to its services. It is completely free and you can login [here](https://developers.giphy.com/) and get your API key.

### How to setup and run:

- Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/Boro23-wq/god-mode-discordjs.git` or download the zip.
- You must have node installed. If not download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Run npm install.
- Run node index.js

## That is all you need. Enjoy!
